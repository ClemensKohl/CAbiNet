However, these visualization approaches do not give any information about the genes that define the cell groups or clusters. It is therefore desirable to display cells and genes simultaneously such that by their relative position to each other information about the genes’ expression in a cluster can be obtained. Here we propose “Correspondence Analysis based Biclustering on Networks” (CAbiNet) as a novel approach to jointly visualize cells and genes by a non-linear embedding approach, called biMAP. The biMAP allows for easy and interactive exploration of cells and their corresponding marker genes in a single plot. CabiNet additionally offers an intuitive way to perform biclustering jointly on cells and genes, providing a simplified workflow to annotate cell types on the biMAP. CAbiNet is accessible through GitHub as an R package.},   langid = {english}, }"},{"path":"/index.html","id":"cabinet","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Biclustering and visualization of scRNAseq data","title":"Biclustering and visualization of scRNAseq data","text":"Correspondence Analysis based Biclustering Networks package provides functions visualization biclustering single-cell RNA-seq data.","code":""},{"path":"/index.html","id":"installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Installation","title":"Biclustering and visualization of scRNAseq data","text":"can install package :","code":"# please also install this version of APL from github: devtools::install_github(\"VingronLab/APL\", ref = \"cabinet\") devtools::install_github(\"VingronLab/CAbiNet\")"},{"path":"/index.html","id":"quick-start","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Quick start","title":"Biclustering and visualization of scRNAseq data","text":"provide short example use package. hope provide detailed description use CAbiNet perform analysis near future.","code":"library(CAbiNet) library(APL) library(scRNAseq)   sce <- DarmanisBrainData()  # Here you might want to do some preprocessing.  # Correspondence Analysis caobj = cacomp(sce,                dims = 50,                top = 1000, # number of genes with highest inertia to keep.                python = TRUE)  # SNN graph & biclustering cabic <- caclust(obj = caobj,                  k = 10,                  loops = FALSE,                  SNN_prune = 1/15,                  mode = \"all\",                  select_genes = TRUE,                  prune_overlap = TRUE,                  overlap = 0.2,                  calc_gene_cell_kNN = FALSE,                  resolution = 1,                  algorithm = 'leiden')  sce$cabinet <- cell_clusters(cabic)  cabic <- biMAP(cabic, k = 30)  # plot results plot_biMAP(cabic, color_genes = TRUE)  # Interactive biMAP where you can mouse over the points to see their identities plot_biMAP(cabic, color_by = \"cluster\",            color_genes = TRUE,            interactive = TRUE)  plot_scatter_biMAP(cabic,                    gene_alpha = 0,                    color_by = \"cell.type\",                    meta_df = colData(sce))"},{"path":"/reference/CAbiNet-package.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"CAbiNet: Correspondence Analysis for Biclustering on Networks — CAbiNet","title":"CAbiNet: Correspondence Analysis for Biclustering on Networks — CAbiNet","text":"CAbiNet provides functions build graphs cells genes well graph clustering methods appropriate graphs.
